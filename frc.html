				<p>Throughout grades 10-12 I was a key member and advisor for FIRST robotics competition team 1374. Over the 3 years, I played a pivotal role in designing, prototyping, and building three robots for three different competitions. My team's alliance came second place at the Georgian College district event 2020. We also won the Team Spirit award at Georgian District event 2020 and the Gracious Professionalism award at the North Bay 2019 district event. Over the course of my 3 years as a memebr of the team, I learned about the design process, how to work effectively with and lead large groups, in-depth SolidWorks CAD skills, and became proficient with various machines (bandsaw, mill, CNC router, laythe etc).

										<p>Our 2019 bot had to take in and shoot inflatable 18" balls into holes of various heights quickly and efficiently. It was one of the best offensive bots for the lower goals at our regional competitions. It was also tasked with climbing onto a 6" platform at the end of the game which it would do consistently, quickyl, and with ease.</p>
