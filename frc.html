				<p>Throughout grades 10-12 I was a key member and advisor for FIRST robotics competition team 1374. Over the 3 years, I played a role in designing, prototyping, and building three robots for three different competitions. 1374's alliance came second place at the Georgian College district event 2020, and we won the Team Spirit award at Georgian District event 2020 and the Gracious Professionalism award at the North Bay 2019 district event.</p>
