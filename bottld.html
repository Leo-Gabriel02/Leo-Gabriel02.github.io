					<p>I founded an environemntal organisation called Bottl'd back in 2018. Bottlâ€™d is a not for profit organization run entirely by students in Oakville. The project is to upcycle thousands of water bottles that would have gone to waste and turn them into greenhouses around our community. By startiong this project, I hoped to inspire others in our region to create change themselves, in addition to reducing waste and encouraging green growing practices. Bottl'd has partnered with the CN tower in Toronto, who provide us empty bottles and who ahve commissioned a greenhouse to be built there. Unfortuanately, this project ahs been put on hold due tro COVID-19 but I hope to start it up again post-pandemic and complete the greenhouse for the CN tower.</p>
