				<p>Back in 2018, I founded an environemntal organisation called Bottl'd back in 2018. Bottlâ€™d is a not for profit organization who's mission is to upcycle thousands of water bottles that would have gone to waste and turn them into greenhouses around our community. By starting this project, I hope to inspire others to passion about the environment, in addition to reducing waste and encouraging green growing practices. Bottl'd has partnered with the CN Tower in Toronto, who provides us empty bottles and who have commissioned a greenhouse to be built on their grounds to be admired by tourists! Unfortuanately, this project has been put on hold due to COVID-19 but I hope to start it up again post-pandemic and complete the greenhouse for the CN tower. Hover over images to learn more!</p>
